This project is to refactor the existing code to increase the accessibility of the company's website.  

In order to achieve this goal, several problems need to be solve:
  - too many non-semantic elements, which cannot clearly state the meaning of the content.
  - no alternate text for an image if the image cannot be displayed.
  - disordered heading attributes
  - no title elements  

The task also highlights the importance of a cascade style sheet.
